# Project Title: Railway Ticket Management System(RTMS)

## Description:
This Railway Ticket Management System is a Python-based application developed as part of a class 11 project in 2021 and enhanced with additional features. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing railway ticket-related tasks, including viewing the train schedule, checking availability by destination, booking tickets, canceling bookings, and graphical representation of the number of trains by destination. The application utilizes libraries such as tkinter for the GUI, pandas for data handling, matplotlib for data visualization, and csv for data storage. This project offers a practical example of a ticket management system that can be used and extended for real-world railway ticketing needs.

## Reason for Choosing the Topic:
The project addresses the need for a systematic approach to handle railway ticket reservations due to the increasing frequency of rail travel. It aims to simplify and streamline the ticket booking process, saving time and effort for passengers. This project was undertaken to make rail travel more efficient and cost-effective for passengers while providing a user-friendly interface.

## Objective:
Check the availability of trains from various locations.
Sort available data by train name and number.
Provide information on available travel classes and berths.
Facilitate the reservation of tickets via a Tkinter-based graphical user interface.
## Hardware & Software Requirements:
### Hardware:
Computer/Laptop with Windows 7 or above
x86 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD architecture)
4 GB RAM

### Software:
Python 3.6.x or higher version (with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries preinstalled) for running the program.
MS Office for creating the required CSV files.

## Limitations:
The project is not web-based and operates on a local machine.
Manual data entry may be time-consuming.
Additional functionality can be added as per specific requirements.
There may be limitations in accuracy, and errors can occur.
